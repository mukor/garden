# Fantasy Garden – Game Summary Document

## 1. Basic Concept and Thesis
**Core Idea:**  
A virtual terrarium “Tamagotchi-like” game for a casual, primarily female audience. Product pillars: 

- **Simple pick-up-and-play**: Almost no onboarding required.  
- **Short session times**: Designed for quick play without monopolizing the TV.  
- **Netflix IP Integration**: Garden flora and fauna are influenced by what you’ve been watching.  
- **Non-competitive social hooks**: Sharing and community-driven discoveries.  

**Primary Goal:**  
Grow a beautiful fantasy garden populated with **plants and animals influenced by Netflix viewing habits**.  

- Fill your **Collection Book** with all plants and critters you acquire.  
- Craft items and enchant seeds to obtain the rarest flora and fauna.

## 2. Basic Gameplay Loop

### Starting Your Garden
- Begin with **Temperate Climate Biome** (default).  
- Unlockable biomes tied to Netflix series completion (e.g., *Wednesday*, *Stranger Things*, *The Witcher*).  
- Garden starts bare except for a few **random initial plants** based on viewing habits.  
- Initial plants are in varying maturity states.

### Planting Seeds

- Seeds offered are based on Netflix habits.  
- After planting, players water them using the watering can.

### Tending the Garden

- **Harvest**: Gather materials; may remove plant.  
- **Pull**: Remove plant.  
- **Fertilize**: Apply a consumable fertilizer.

## 4. Collection System

- **IP-based collections** grant elite tier recipes/features.  
- First session gives endowed progress with pre-collected plants.

## 5. Enchanting & Crafting (Later Unlock)
- Use materials from plants and fauna to **enchant seeds** → create hybrid plants.  
- Hybrids attract different fauna.  
- Recipes learned via **trial and error** or shared in community forums.

---

## 6. Trading (Later Unlock)
- Trade rare plants, materials, and consumables between players.  
- Economy/currency TBD.

---

## 7. Events (Later Unlock)
